# token

token is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. The bot keeps track of acknowledgment or thanks given from one user to another. Each unit of acknowledgment is called a "token". Users can send tokens one at a time to other users. They can also revoke or rescind a token. Finally, users can ask the bot to show the status of a user and show the leaderboard of who has received the most tokens. 

This bot was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku].

### Running token Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start token locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    token> [Mon Jul 18 2016 12:10:53 GMT-0500 (CDT)] INFO hubot-redis-brain: Using default redis on localhost:6379
    token>

Then you can interact with token by typing `token help`.

    token> token help
    token give a token to @user_name - Gives a token to `@user_name`. The words 'token', 'a' and 'to' are optional.
    token help - Displays all of the help commands that token knows about.
    ...

### Configuration

The following environment variables can optionally be set: 

`TOKEN_ALLOW_SELF` (if not set, the default is `false`)
`TOKENS_CAN_BE_TRANSFERRED` (if not set, the default is `true`)
`TOKENS_ENDOWED_TO_EACH_USER`  (if not set, the default is 5)

How to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.
Rather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,
it's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide][scripting-docs].

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### external-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com][npmjs] or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

##### Advanced Usage

It is also possible to define `external-scripts.json` as an object to
explicitly specify which scripts from a package should be included. The example
below, for example, will only activate two of the six available scripts inside
the `hubot-fun` plugin, but all four of those in `hubot-auto-deploy`.

```json
{
  "hubot-fun": [
    "crazy",
    "thanks"
  ],
  "hubot-auto-deploy": "*"
}
```

**Be aware that not all plugins support this usage and will typically fallback
to including all scripts.**

### hubot-scripts

Before hubot plugin packages were adopted, most plugins were held in the
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] package. Some of these plugins have yet to be
migrated to their own packages. They can still be used but the setup is a bit
different.

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested),
you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`
from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.
