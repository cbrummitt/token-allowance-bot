# token

token is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. The bot keeps track of acknowledgment or thanks given from one user to another. Each unit of acknowledgment is called a "token". Users can send tokens one at a time to other users. They can also revoke or rescind a token. Finally, users can ask the bot to show the status of a user and show the leaderboard of who has received the most tokens. 

## Technical information 

### Generation 

This bot was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku].

[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com
[hubot]: http://hubot.github.com
[generator-hubot]: https://github.com/github/generator-hubot

### Running token Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start token locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    token> [Mon Jul 18 2016 12:10:53 GMT-0500 (CDT)] INFO hubot-redis-brain: Using default redis on localhost:6379
    token>

Then you can interact with token by typing `token help`.

    token> token help
    token give a token to @user_name - Gives a token to `@user_name`. The words 'token', 'a' and 'to' are optional.
    token help - Displays all of the help commands that token knows about.
    ...

### Configuration

The following environment variables can optionally be set: 

`TOKEN_ALLOW_SELF` (if not set, the default is `false`)
`TOKENS_CAN_BE_TRANSFERRED` (if not set, the default is `true`)
`TOKENS_ENDOWED_TO_EACH_USER`  (if not set, the default is 5)

How to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.
Rather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,
it's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.
